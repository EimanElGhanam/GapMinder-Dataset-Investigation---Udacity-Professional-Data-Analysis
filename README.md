This repository includes the relevant files for Gap Minder Dataset Investigation, which is submitted and accepted for the 2nd project of Udacity's Professional Data Analysis Nanodegree Program.

Gapminder is an independent educational non-proﬁt-making organization, that aims to ﬁght misconceptions about different global trends through extensive data analysis. In particular, the Gapminder World Dataset is a large collection of files containing data about people from different countries collected over a number of years, that can be used to study different patterns related to population growth, health, education, employment rates, etc.

In this project, a subset of the Gapminder World Dataset is investigated to study the education levels and unemployment rates of people across the two genders, belonging to different age groups and living in different countries. The data used in this project is obtained from GitHub through: https://github.com/open-numbers/ddf--gapminder--systema_globalis, and is accessible free-of-charge by GAPMINDER.ORG under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.
